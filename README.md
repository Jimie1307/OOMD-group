# OOMD-group
My group project for OOMD course

## Introduction
<br>
Involves all the files I majority did to build my group's charity management website. I was the compiler. I did the admin's part, including some (amybe majority tbh)
parts of my group members.
It is A LOT and that is because I just realised (from a convo I had with a senior) that we probably learnt pure PHP. There is no framework involved. Just pure <i>✨PHP vibes✨</i>~
<br> I used Notepad++ and XAMPP only. We were new to web engineering so yes...it is a mess, but hey, it is an assignment so..

## What does this website/system supposed to do?
Supposedly to provide a platform for charity organizations to post their events, and collect participants. The organizations need to request to be a part of the system.
<br> To be fiar, I do not remember much because it is a lot.
